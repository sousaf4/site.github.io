If I leave here tomorrow

Would you still remember me?

For I must be traveling on now

'Cause there's too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl

Things just couldn't be the same

'Cause I'm as free as a bird now

And this bird you cannot change

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And the bird you cannot change

And this bird you cannot change

Lord knows I can't change

Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah, yeah

Though this feeling I can't change

But, please, don't take it so badly

'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

But if I stay here with you, girl

Things just couldn't be the same

'Cause I'm as free as a bird now

And this bird you cannot change

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And the bird you cannot change

And this bird you cannot change

Lord knows I can't change

Lord, help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change

Won't you fly high, free bird? Yeah
