Georgia, Georgia

The whole day through (the whole day through)

Just an old sweet song

Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)

I said Georgia

Georgia

A song of you (a song of you)

Comes as sweet and clear

As moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me

Other eyes smile tenderly

Still in peaceful dreams I see

The road leads back to you

I said Georgia

Oh Georgia, no peace I find (no peace I find)

Just an old sweet song

Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)

Other arms reach out to me

Other eyes smile tenderly

Still in peaceful dreams I see

The road leads back to you

Whoa-whoa, Georgia

Georgia

No peace, no peace I find

Just an old, sweet song

Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)

I said just an old sweet song

Keeps Georgia on my mind
