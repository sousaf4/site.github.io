¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro

Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song

A young girl with eyes like the desert

It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature wild and free

This is where I long to be

La Isla Bonita

And when the samba played

The Sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro

Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me

Te dijo: Te amo

I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature wild and free

This is where I long to be

La Isla Bonita

And when the samba played

The Sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the Sun warms the sky

When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by

Beautiful faces, no cares in this world

Where a girl loves a boy and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro

It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature wild and free

This is where I long to be

La Isla Bonita

And when the samba played
The Sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita

And when the samba played
The Sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Te dijo: Te amo
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Él dijo que te ama

(La Isla Bonita)
(Spanish lullaby)
