One, two, three

Turn It Up

Big wheels keep on turnin'

Carry me home to see my kin

Singin' songs about the south-land

I miss alabama once again

And I think it's a sin, yes

Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her

Well, I heard old Neil put her down

Well, I hope Neil Young will remember

A southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama

Where the skies are so blue

Sweet home Alabama

Lord, I'm comin' home to you

In Birmingham, they love the governor
(Boo-hoo-hoo)

Now, we all did what we could do

Now Watergate does not bother me

Does your conscience bother you?

Tell the truth

Sweet home Alabama

Where the skies are so blue

Sweet home Alabama

Lord, I'm comin' home to you

Here I come, Alabama

Ooh, oh, oh

Alabama, oh, oh, oh

Alabama, oh, oh, oh

Alabama, oh, oh, oh

Alabama.

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers

And they've been known to pick a song or two
(yes, they do)

Lord, they get me off so much

They pick me up when I'm feeling blue

Now, how about you?

Sweet home Alabama

Where the skies are so blue

Sweet home Alabama

Lord, I'm comin' home to you

Sweet home Alabama

Sweet home, baby

Where the skies are so blue

And the governor's true

Sweet home Alabama

Lordy, Lord, I'm coming home to you

Montgomery's got the answer
